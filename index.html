        <h4 class="Text-capatilize">We provide residential facility to a limited number of students (both boys and girls) on the school campus. The boys' hostel with the capacity for 40 residents is located within the premises of KC Sports Club adjacent to the school campus. It is a fully air-conditioned facility. Resident girls are accommodated in a separate building within the school campus. The facility has been provided essentially to cope with demand for admissions from remote areas of Jammu & Kashmir such as Ladakh and Indo-Pak border.

            The hostel premises are well maintained by in-house staff and the children are looked after by responsible and caring wardens. The mess facility for residents is first rate and is supervised by a qualified and experienced mess manager. </h4>
